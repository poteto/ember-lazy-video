# How to contribute

## Goals
The goal and scope of the component is simple – be really good at lazy loading videos. This means being able to lazy load videos from any `provider`. The component should also be customizable to a certain degree: for example, being able to change the play button style/template, or being able to pass in their own thumbnail. Customization does not entail changing the functionality of the component, although it is possible we could abstract this out (in a seperate repo) so that it could lazy load any element.

## Where you can help
You can contribute code, design (maybe 'themes' for buttons?), write documentation, fix typos, raise issues and so on. There's more to open source contribution than just code! Any help would be most welcome, as long as the guidelines are followed.

## Making changes
This repo uses the `gitflow` [branching model](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) – this means you'll need to fork the `develop` branch instead of `master`, and submit pull requests to target `develop`. You don't strictly have to create your own `feature` branches, although that would be nice.

Please avoid working on `master`!
