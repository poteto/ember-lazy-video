`ember-lazy-video` is a simple component and service that deals with lazy loading of videos from specified providers.

## Usage

`ember-lazy-video` currently supports lazy loading videos from Youtube, Vimeo and Instagram.  Usage in your app is as simple as passing the video's url into a `lazy-video` component:

`{{lazy-video video="https://vimeo.com/108532122"}}`

`{{lazy-video video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD72LbIk02M"}}`

`{{lazy-video video="http://instagram.com/p/vXeXAnsieB/"}}`

## Contribution
Please read the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute.

The goal and scope of the component is simple â€“ be really good at lazy loading videos. This means being able to lazy load videos from any `provider`. The component should also be customizable to a certain degree: for example, being able to change the play button style/template, or being able to pass in their own thumbnail. Customization does not entail changing the functionality of the component, although it is possible we could abstract this out (in a separate repo) so that it could lazy load any element.
